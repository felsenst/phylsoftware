# phylsoftware

This repository holds the HTML files for the Phylogeny Programs web pages.

These listings started as a list of 17 phylogeny packages or programs that was part of my PHYLIP package.  Once it got longer than this it was posted as web pages at the PHYLIP website.  Ultimately it grew to listings of over 300 programs or packages.  In 2012 the burden of maintaining it became too great and I stopped adding listings.  Now that I have Github pages for myself and archives for myself, for PHYLIP, I am moving the Phylogeny Software web pages here, and hope to enlist you to be part of a team that maintains them.

The pages are the ones that start with "software" and are HTML web pages.  The icons used in the program/package entries and in the visual display at the top of the initial page are small 32x32 graphic files in folder "icons".
You may try an edit of these files.  I strongly suggest you do it one entry at a time.  Then you have to submit your changes to me with a "pull request" (I am still learning how to do these).  I reserve the right to disagree with your decisions and either ask you to revise the submission, or edit it myself.

Note that the software pages are loosely grouped by program function.  I will describe this here soon.

###RULES
1.  You may not describe a program in terms of superlatives, such as "Foobar is the best program for inverting phylogenies backwards" or "Foobar is the fastest program for inverting phylogenies backwards"
2. You may not make invidious comparisons to other programs, such as "Foobar is better for this purpose than program Tarfu"
3. You should make one entry per package, not one entry for each program in a package.


Program entries should be short, similar in length to present entries.  You should also make entries for the program in the indexes that list programs by function, and the one that lists them by operating system or platform (such as R), and the cross-reference listing.

If you see out-of-date entries that need updating of version numbers, capabilities, or links, please help us correct them.  If you see entries that are for defunct (unavailable) programs please help us move their entries, mostly unchanged, to software.old.html.  It is important to keep them mostly intact, even with bad links, as sometimes links revive or programs are re-posted at the same location or at a different location.

More will be written here soon, explaining in more detail the format of program or package entries.
We are just getting started with this project and hope it can bring the Phylogeny Software listings up to date soon.  We will shortly also start a list of people who have contributed, as part of the pages.

Many thanks for thinking of helping with this project.
